A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once.
If the knight ends on a square that is one knight's move from the beginning square (so that it could tour the board again immediately,
following the same path),the tour is closed; otherwise, it is open.
The knight's tour problem is the mathematical problem of finding a knight's tour.

my program is solving this problem (on a 8 x 8 chessboards).
